## Notes to professor

Please do not trust the commits/contribution graph on the master repo. All of us doing equal amount of work to complete this project. We're 
having trouble on the master commits/contribution, as we merge the branches of all team members, we're missing a lot of 
commits from the branches. Please check out commits on all the branches. All of our members are contributing and spend a huge
amount of times in this project, so we think it is unfair to if some of us getting bad grade because of the low commits showed 
in the master repo. Thanks.
